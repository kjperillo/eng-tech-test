Cloud Engineer Technical Test

Objective:
Design a cloud infrastructure that includes network configuration, storage, and serverless computing using either AWS or Azure. Implement this infrastructure using Terraform and script a serverless function in Python to interact with the cloud storage.

You do not need to actually launch this as part of the test, 

Requirements:
•Cloud Provider Choice:
   - Choose either AWS or Azure for implementing the solution.

•Network Configuration:
   - Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS or a Virtual Network (VNet) on Azure with the following details:
     - One public subnet
     - One private subnet
     - One NAT gateway

•Storage:
   - Set up an S3 bucket on AWS or a storage container on Azure.

•Serverless Function:
   - Implement a Lambda function on AWS or a Function App on Azure using Python.
   - The function should trigger on an event indicating that a new file has been uploaded to the cloud storage.
   - Read the contents of the newly uploaded file and print them to a log.

•Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
   - Use Terraform to script all the infrastructure components.
   - Ensure your Terraform scripts include appropriate modules, variables, and outputs for reusability and maintainability.

•Documentation and Clean Code:
   - Document your Python script and Terraform configuration for clarity and maintainability.
 

Deliverables:
- Terraform files for setting up the VPC/VNet, subnets, S3/storage container, and Lambda/Function App.
- Python script for the serverless function.
- You do not need to launch this into an actual environment, simply upload the files to a public repository (GitHub, GitLab) or email a zip file.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness of the implementation.
- Adherence to cloud best practices for security and architecture.
- Quality of the Terraform scripts in terms of structure, use of modules, and ease of maintenance.
- Functionality of the Python script and its error handling capabilities.
- Clarity and detail in documentation.
